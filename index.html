		<h1>Wade's Life</h1> <br>

		<p>	My journey to programming has been a long and sparce one. I started programming in high school 
		   but I had not programmed in years after high school. There was really no one that I know that knew 
		   about writing code, and no one that was interested really.</p><br>

		<p>	I have been picking up some programming again about a couple of years ago after I watch some videos
		    about hacking and programming in general. I guess you could say that it re-lit a fire of curiosity about 
		    how thing were done today rather that twenty years ago. So I started randomly picking things up and I 
		    built a ugly webite(a few) but I caught the bug for programming again once I got it working.</p><br>

		<p>	All of that brings me to today. Since then I have built some website that were okay and
		    I have built a website for a local martial arts acadamey that my children go to. I was very excited about
		    how it turned out but I have lots of room for improvement. I have since learned a little about HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, and started learning a little about Node and Express. All of that to say that when I heard about bootcamps I ceased the moment
		    and decided to give it a more serious go.</p>
