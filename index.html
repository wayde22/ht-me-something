		<h1>The Journey to Now</h1> <br>

		<p>
			My journey to programming has been a long and sparce one. I started programming in high school on an old
			Apple IIe using Basic doing some low and high resolution graphics and various other things. I loved doing those little projects for the class. I went on to help the computer teacher teach programming the next year as a senior. After highschool I found myself 
			entering the workforce and never really touch a computer for years afterwards. There was really no one that I knew that knew 
		   anything about writing code, and no one that I knew was interested really. So, for the longest time that had stifled 
		   programming for me.
		</p><br>

			I had started picking up some coding again about a couple of years ago after I watched some videos
		    about hacking, programming and web related programming. I guess you could say that it re-lit a fire of curiosity about 
		    how thing were done today rather that twenty years ago. So I started randomly picking things up and I 
		    built a ugly website(a few) but I caught the bug for programming again once I got it working. So as I played 
		    around with a programmed called Dreamweaver in a class from college but that just made me want to learn 
		    to code that much more because I was not just happy with creating a site from a WYSIWYG I wanted to know 
		    how all this stuff worked under the hood. So that began my adventured at home.

			All of that brings me to today. Since then I have built some websites that were too bad and
		    I have built a website for a local martial arts acadamey that my children go to. I was very excited about
		    how it turned out but I have lots of room for improvement. I have since learned a little about HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, and  started learning a little about Node and Express but at this present time I couldn't tell you much about it. All of that to say that when I heard about bootcamps I decided to check them out and see if it would benefit me at all. As 
		    it turns out, after I getting ready to fly out to San Fransico and give Hack Reactor a go, I stumbled upon 
		    Launch Code and decided that since it was closer I would give it a shot.
